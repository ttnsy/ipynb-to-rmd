## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# call all libraries
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)


# data manipulation
births <- births %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date), month = month(date))

# data visualization
plot(births$date, births$births, type="l", xaxt="n")
points(
  x =  births[births$month == 2, "date"],
  y = births[births$month == 2, "births"], col="darkred", pch=19)
points(
  x =  births[births$month == 7, "date"],
  y = births[births$month == 7, "births"], col="dodgerblue4", pch=19)
axis(1, births$date[seq(2, length(births$date), by = 12)], format(births$date[seq(2, length(births$date), by = 12)], "%b %y"), cex.axis=0.5)

```


```{r cars}
# pretend that we have a lot of code in this chunk
if (1 + 1 == 2) {
  # of course that is true
  print(mtcars)
  # we just printed a lengthy data set
}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
